# Lab 4: Tkinter and PyQt

This project demonstrates a collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub. It combines the two different approaches developed in Lab2, Tkinter and PyQt, into a single application that can be launched with either interface.

## How to Run the Application

To run the application, you need to use the `main.py` script from your terminal. You must specify which user interface you want to launch using the `--ui` flag.

### 1. To Launch the Tkinter Interface

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python tkinter_app.py
```


### 2. To Launch the PyQT Interface

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python pyqt_app.py
```
